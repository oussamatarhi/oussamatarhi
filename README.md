# Hi there! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm excited to embark on my journey into programming, with a focus on web development. Here's a little about me and what I'm working on:

## About Me

- 🌱 **Learning Journey**: I'm just starting out in the world of programming. My main resources for learning are:
  - [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/): A comprehensive curriculum for web development.
  - [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/): Harvard's introduction to computer science.

- 🎯 **Goals**:
  - Build a strong foundation in programming concepts and web development.
  - Create projects that showcase my progress and skills.
  - Contribute to open-source projects as I grow my expertise.

- 🛠️ **Tools I'm Exploring**:
  - Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration.
  - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as the core technologies for web development.

## What to Expect Here

This GitHub repository will serve as a record of my learning journey. You'll find:
- **Projects**: Small projects and exercises as I progress through The Odin Project and CS50.
- **Notes**: Documentation and learnings to keep track of my understanding.
- **Experiments**: Fun side projects to explore new concepts.

Feel free to follow along, leave suggestions, or share advice! I'm eager to connect with others in the programming community. 😊
